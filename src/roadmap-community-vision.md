# Open Source Community Vision

Some tools are developed in workplaces for niche use-cases that repeat between different companies, workplaces and clients, where skilled workers find themselves create, write and design the same tools over and over again, having no common standard.   

My vision is to create some of these tools to be publicly available for free, encourage and build an open-source community around them in order to:  
 - Provide a common language and standard for common niche projects
 - Provide quick-to-deploy, high-quality, capable and reliable solutions to impress our bosses or clients
 - Gain common, shared, technical experience around them to configure and maintain them, providing better support 
 - Provide higher quality of manpower for companies by providing potential workers with relevant experience for common community tools with excellent resources
 - Create job opportunities for the community as they easily solve their bosses or clients problems with easy to maintain, standard community solutions
